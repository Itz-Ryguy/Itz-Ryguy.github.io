        <h2 class="TAPinfo">TAP also known as the Technology Advantage Program is a 6 year program that starts in grade nine but students would apply and have to do an interview back in grade 8 to be accepted. TAP focuses on teaching students with technology skills, whether those are Coding, or building computers. And just Teaching students using technology that they havenâ€™t used prior to the program. But since high school is only 4 years, they also spend their High School years gaining the necessary credits to get into 1 out of 4 programs that are pre-paid for them, we will go over those 4 programs later. The TAP class program is only in 3 places in Nova Scotia.</h2>
