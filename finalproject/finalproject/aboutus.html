        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <h2>It all began one day when, two men were thinking about becoming entrepreneurs. One of those men came up with the idea of making a company that has a website online where you can shop for all sorts of cool electronics. This would include gaming consoles, games and other accessories like headsets and speakers. They both agreed on this idea and the second man decided he would create a merchandise website, selling pieces of clothing with their logo on it to help support the company. So off they went! They created their own websites, which brings us to where we are today.</h2>
